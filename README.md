# Webpack Template for future The Odin Project projects

A base webpack template that future projects will utilise for easier project setup

## How to use

Just run "npm install" and you're good to go

## This contains 3 different scripts

-   **"npm start"** to open a live server and preview live changes
-   **"npm run devbuild"** to run a development build
-   **"npm run build"** to run a production build

## Things left to implement

-   Display current TODO Project in header (Center on mobile and left of "TODO Task" on desktop)
-   Utilize local storage to save and load projects on different devices
-   Use **"date-fns"** to display TODO's for current project by 24 hours, 1 week or 1 month
-   Create way to edit a TODO Task
-   Option to sort by priority
-   Option to switch to newly created TODO Project to start adding TODO Tasks immediately
